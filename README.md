# Project
QA final project

This is a simple flask-app designed to work with a sqlite database.  It is a recipe app tracking ingredients, built using the Jenkins pipeline, using GitHub as the SCM and deployed in Azure using containers on VM's.

After getting the application performing CRUD functionality, I am pushing it to GitHub so that it can be pulled down by Jenkins via the webhook.
