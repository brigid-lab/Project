# Project
QA final project

This is a simple flask-app designed to work with a sqlite database.  It is a recipe app tracking ingredients, built using the Jenkins pipeline, using GitHub as the SCM and deployed in Azure using containers on VM's.

After getting the application performing CRUD functionality, I am pushing it to GitHub so that it can be pulled down by Jenkins via the webhook.

OK, so now Video has been done, its time to review what i've learnt.

So the things I would do differently are: 1) Learn GitHub better and use branches 2) in a production environment use the credentials store in Jenkins
